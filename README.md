# Asteroids in C++ and SDL

- [Screenshots](#screenshots)

# Idea and Goal of the project
The project's main goal was to learn SDL, different design patterns, and game development in general. To spice things up, I set myself a rule to not have any memory allocations in runtime, which has caused me a lot of headaches, but I learned a lot about memory management and memory leaks.

# Concepts learned
- SDL
- Entity Component System
- Data Oriented Design
- Bitwise Operations
- Error Handling with asserts
- C++ Templates
- Operator Overloading
- Collision Detection
- Memory Management
- Perforce Version Control
- Visual Studio Project Configuration and Debugging
- Game loop, delta time, event polling, *and many more...*

### In debug mode, you can see the collisions of the entities
